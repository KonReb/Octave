Allows to access a database with Octave commands. Place the .ps-files into your powershell home. 
Use the m-files to access a database. Here an Access 2013 is used. Write to and query the Database. Is slow but works.

If you use Access 32bit use powershell (x86)
This is how it was used.
Should also work for SQL server and everything that Powershell can handle.
